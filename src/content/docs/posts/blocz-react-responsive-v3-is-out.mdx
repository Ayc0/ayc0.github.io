import LinkToPost from "@components/LinkToPost.astro";

The v3 of `@blocz/react-responsive` was just released with few bug fixes and new names. You can check out the full release details here: https://github.com/bloczjs/react-responsive/releases/tag/v3.0.0

## Features

- performance
- TypeScript support
- CSS-in-JS compatibilities
- customizable
- SSR compatible

### Some history

3 years ago, I needed a way in react to display a component or another one, depending on whether or not the page was viewed on mobile or in desktop. I had 2 things in mind:

- avoid rendering some components depending on the viewport size (and not using `display: null`),
- define a set of predefined breakpoints and not having to redefine them every time,
- breakpoints should be ranges of sizes instead of actual breakpoints: when someone uses `md`, they usually don't want to apply this to `sm` too (except if you specify `md down`).

And none of the libraries that existed at the time were able to provide those features. So I createdAt mine: `react-only`.

This library evolved as the react community evolved too:

- in the v0 we had breakpoints, providers, and support for CSS-in-JS
- the v1 was a major re-write in TypeScript and around react hooks (checkout out the following post for tips on how to upgrade class components to hooks)
  <LinkToPost slug="migrating-class-components-to-hooks" />
- the v2 was a major re-write for react contexts (the previous implementation didn't work if we had multiple providers in the same app)

### v3

All this time, we kept the name `react-only` but it never described what this library was for. So in this v3, we decided to rename it to `@blocz/react-responsive` and in general to use better names for the exported functions.

## API

### Hooks

`@blocz/react-responsive` is centered around 2 hooks:

- `useMediaQuery` to detect if the current view matches the given media query (string)
- `useBreakpoint` to detect if the current view matches predefined breakpoints

Example:

```jsx
import { useBreakpoint, useMediaQuery } from "@blocz/react-responsive";

const Breakpoints = () => {
  const matchXl = useBreakpoint("xl");
  const matchMdDown = useBreakpoint("mdDown");
  const matchMdOrLg = useBreakpoint("md lg");
  return (
    <ul>
      {matchXl && <li>Visible on every "large" device</li>}
      {matchMdDown && (
        <li>Visible on every device smaller or equal than "medium"</li>
      )}
      {matchMdOrLg && <li>Visible on every "medium" or "large" device</li>}
    </ul>
  );
};

const MediaQuery = () => {
  const matchMediaQuery = useMediaQuery(
    "(min-width:768px) and (max-width:992px)",
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {matchMediaQuery && (
        <li>Visible at (min-width:768px) and (max-width:992px)</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

### Performance

To check if a breakpoint / media query matches or not the current viewport, we don't use event listeners on the resize event, but instead we use `matchMedia` so that we only run JS code when the media queries start/stop matching and not at each resize.

### Breakpoints

By default, those predefined breakpoints are used:

| Breakpoint | From   | To       |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| xs         | 0px    | 575px    |
| sm         | 576px  | 767px    |
| md         | 768px  | 991px    |
| lg         | 992px  | 1199px   |
| xl         | 1200px | Infinity |

And also all those breakpoints exist in Up and Down variants: `smDown` is from 0px to 767px, etc.

But if you need other breakpoints, you can use the [`<BreakpointProvider>` component](https://github.com/bloczjs/react-responsive#breakpointsprovider)

#### Direction

Breakpoints are by default set on the horizontal axis, but you can also set them on the vertical axis to check the height of the viewport.

#### Unit

By default, breakpoint will use `px` but you can use `em` or any valid CSS unit.

### CSS-in-JS

When we createdAt the library, we were using [styletron](https://github.com/styletron/styletron) for our styles, and we wanted to bind the breakpoints we defined in `@blocz/react-responsive` with the breakpoints used for our styles.

So we added support for CSS-in-JS with our `toJSON` (for a library like `styletron`) and `toCSS` (for a library like `emotion`) utility functions:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { toJSON as createToJSON, toCSS as createToCSS , BreakpointsContext } from "@blocz/react-responsive";

const styles = {
  mdDown: {
    color: "red",
    ":hover": { color: "blue" },
  },
  lgUp: {
    color: "green",
  },
};

const App = () => {
  const breakpoints = React.useContext(BreakpointsContext);

  const toJSON = createToJSON(breakpoints);
  // toJSON(styles) returns:
  // {
  //   "@media  (max-width:991px)": {
  //     "color": "red",
  //     ":hover": {
  //       "color": "blue"
  //     }
  //   },
  //   "@media  (min-width:992px)": {
  //     "color": "green"
  //   }
  // }

  const toCSS = createToCSS(breakpoints);
  // toCSS(styles) returns:
  // `@media  (max-width:991px) {
  //   color: red;
  //   :hover {
  //     color: blue;
  //   }
  // }
  // @media  (min-width:992px) {
  //   color: green;
  // }`
```

### SSR

The library by itself doesn’t provide any mocks for window.matchMedia for SSR. But if you use one, like [mock-match-media](https://github.com/Ayc0/mock-match-media/), `@blocz/react-responsive` will listen to it.

If you need an example, you can check out the tests done here: https://github.com/bloczjs/react-responsive/blob/b8e6611/packages/tests/src/__tests__/ssr.ts

We render a page with `@testing-library/react`'s render function on multiple different screen sizes with mock-match-media's `setMedia` function.
