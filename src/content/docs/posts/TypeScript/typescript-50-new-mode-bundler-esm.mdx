description: "TypeScript 5.0 is out and introduced a new compilation option: `moduleResolution: bundler`, let’s see how we can use it"
---

In TypeScript 5.0, 2 new features were released:

- `moduleResolution: bundler`
- `allowImportingTsExtensions`

([see release note](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#moduleresolution-bundler))

Let’s dive into what these allow us to solve.

## Problem

### Introduction

Let’s take this piece of code:

```ts
// INPUT
// foo.ts
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.ts
import { foo } from "./foo";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

If we want to transpile this plain JavaScript, with `module: CommonJS` set in our `tsconfig.json`, we’d get something like:

```js
// OUTPUT
// foo.js
exports.foo = "foo";

// bar.js
const { foo } = require("./foo");

exports.bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

But now you could tell me:

> “Wait, I thought that JS now supports import/export? Also, isn’t this require/exports only for Node.js?”

Yes, you’re totally right! import/export are part of [ESM (ECMAScript Modules)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). And require/exports are indeed only valid in Node.js.

Let’s try to use ESM!

### ESM

You can enable this via `module: es6 / es2020 / esnext / node16` in your `tsconfig.json`.
With the same input, we’d get:

```js
// OUTPUT
// foo.js
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.js
import { foo } from "./foo";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

> “Wait, what’s the catch here? This seems to be valid!”

In the ECMAScript spec, they mention that imports need to have a **file extension**, so `import { foo } from './foo';` is **not** valid (see in [Node.js’s doc](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#mandatory-file-extensions)).

### Which extension should we pick?

Okay, let’s say I want to build for ESM, what extension should I write in my source code?
Let’s try a different code samples:

#### `.ts`

With a `.ts` extension:

```ts
// INPUT
// foo.ts
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.ts
import { foo } from "./foo.ts";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

we’d get this code in JS:

```js
// OUTPUT
// foo.js
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.js
import { foo } from "./foo.ts";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

You can see that this **cannot** work: `foo.ts` doesn’t exist in the generated code as the generated file is named `foo.js`

#### `.js`

Okay, so what about with a `.js` file then?

```ts
// INPUT
// foo.ts
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.ts
import { foo } from "./foo.js";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

This would generate:

```js
// OUTPUT
// foo.js
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.js
import { foo } from "./foo.js";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

This indeed works! Hoorah! We have some working code with TypeScript & ESM 🎉
This is the official way of supporting ESM in TS files: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html.

The only issue is that we have to write down `foo.js` in the source TS file, which is weird 😕 (as the file doesn’t exist during dev time).

#### Why are extensions required in ESM?

Due to how the web works, it has to work with files that are fully pre-determined, otherwise when writing `import './foo'`, if it implemented the same logic as node, we’d have to download: `foo.js`, `foo.cjs`, `foo.mjs`, `foo/index.js`, etc.
So for browsers, it makes more sense to treat the import as the reference.

#### Why isn’t the transform of the extension automatically done by TypeScript?

TypeScript never rewrites module specifiers in its JavaScript emit.

I don’t have the exact reasons why they don’t do it, but to me this would counterproductive as there are more differences between CommonJS & ESM (see [TS v4.7 release note](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-7.html#type-in-packagejson-and-new-extensions)).
So enforcing the use of the extensions, is a great way to tell people that we are in ESM, and also is closer to the underlying generated JS logic.

### Summary of the issue

To support ESM, we need to:

- Change all imports use `.js`, `.cjs`, or `.mjs` -> large update,
- The new imports don’t match the source files,
- Tools like webpack/esbuild/deno do support `.ts` files in paths, so why is this an issue?

## Solution: `allowImportingTsExtensions`

In TypeScript 5.0, a new option was added: `allowImportingTsExtensions`, which allows users to use `.ts` in imports!

The only requirement with it, is that we [**cannot emit code anymore**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowImportingTsExtensions) (as this wouldn’t produce any valid JavaScript code).

So either `noEmit: true` needs to be set, or `emitDeclarationOnly: true` (as importing `.ts` files is allowed in `.d.ts` files).

We can now write the following (useful for Deno for instance):

```ts
// INPUT
// foo.ts
export const foo = "foo";

// bar.ts
import { foo } from "./foo.ts";

export const bar = `${foo} sets a new bar`;
```

## Solution: `moduleResolution: bundler`

Enabling the `.ts` extension is already a bonus, but why should we write any extension at all when the code is bundled anyway by Webpack, Vite, esbuild, Parcel, rollup, swc?

If your **code is bundled**, there is now a new option that you can use starting with TypeScript 5.0: `moduleResolution: bundler` ([see PR that added it](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/51669)).

This:

- tells TypeScript that you’re code will be bundled by another tool, and thus to loosen the rules with imports (can have no extension, or use `.ts` extensions)
- requires to use `module` set to `es2015` or later (which enables parsing `exports` in package.json and other changes)

Note: Using es2015 or later will enable new rules in TS (e.g.: like disabling `require`), so it won’t be a no-op.

## Conclusion

Module resolution in TypeScript is complex, and has evolved over the years. TypeScript 5.0 added 2 new tools to allow adapting the tool in more contexts than before. But they all come with requirements.
