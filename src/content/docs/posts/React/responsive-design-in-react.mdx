Hi, I'm Ayc0, maintainer of the library [`@blocz/react-responsive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blocz/react-responsive) that aims to provide easy utils in React to handle Responsive design.

If you want to learn more about it, you can check this post:

<LinkToPost slug="others/blocz-react-responsive-v3-is-out" />

This article will tell you how **not** to use this library.

## When not to use `@blocz/react-responsive`

Often, I get people asking me how to use `@blocz/react-responsive` to handle different display at different screen sizes, or on mobile.
Usually my answer is: use plain **CSS and media queries**.

CSS is my go-to method when I want handle responsive design:

- it's easy `@media (max-width: Xpx)`
- it's static and doesn't require JS to run (more efficient for the end user)

## Then why did you create this library if you don't recommend it?

I do recommend it, but not for all use-cases.

1. `@blocz/react-responsive` was developed to allow developers to **render different components** depending of viewport size.
   For instance, you want to render a dropdown option on desktop and a floating button action on mobile and you already have both components developed.

2. The second use-case was to be able to have breakpoints that could be used at the same time in the JS and in **CSS-in-JS**, that you can set top level in your app and re-use in an easy way.

## To sum up

If you just need to change how a component looks depending on the viewport size, you should use plain CSS. But if you need a finer control in your JS, you can look at ways to do that in JS and why not give a try to `@blocz/react-responsive`.
