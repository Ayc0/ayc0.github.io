:::caution[Warning]
Still in draft
:::

Hello, Iâ€™m Ayc0 ðŸ‘‹. I started coding in React in 2016, around the [v15.3.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/15.3.1) (which is around {new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years ago!). Iâ€™m the maintainer of [`@blocz/react-responsive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blocz/react-responsive), did a few open-source contributions, and have been working professionally with React for also a few years.

Why am I saying this? I do not consider myself bad with React (not the best either ðŸ™ˆ). But even after so many years spent working with it, there are a lot of elements that I never truly understood, nor even really questioned before.

This article will be about all of those elements ðŸ˜…

### Disclaimer

- Everything I will present in this article is based on my understanding & findings while playing with React.\
  So not everything may be 100% accurate,
- All of those could change in new versions of React, already have changed actually in the past (which is a good thing).

Iâ€™ll be using the latest version of the time of writing, being the v18.x.x.

You can find all those experiments on https://ayc0.github.io/react-timings/. \
And the source code is available in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Ayc0/ayc0.github.io/tree/0a265b6/src/components/page-react-timings).

## Life-cycles

First question we need answering: in which order are life cycles called?

:::note[Note]
The concept of lifecycle in React is classically associated with class components: methods like `componentDidMount`, etc.

Iâ€™ll also use this name to refer to hooks provided by React, such as `useEffect` (for simplicity).
:::

To measure this, we can use a code snippet like such:

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import aRaw from "@components/post-react-life-cycles-and-timings/a.tsx?raw";
import { A } from "@components/post-react-life-cycles-and-timings/a.tsx";

<Code lang="tsx" code={aRaw.split("// ---")[1].trim()} />

<A client:only="react" />
