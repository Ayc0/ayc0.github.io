## Color scheme

If you already have a website working, and you haven't used any styles (no custom background, no custom color, no custom inputs), then you can use in your HTML:

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

or in your CSS:

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
```

This will enable both default `light` and `dark` modes for your website and will follow your system mode (no toggle available in the UI).

You can read more about it here: https://web.dev/color-scheme/.

## System colors

There is also another powerful tool available to us: native system themed colors.

In CSS, you can say that a color should follow the system color for multiple semantic elements, like `LinkText`, or `Canvas` (background color):

![A few examples of system colors](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itysdasc4tlijyvg12og.png)

The best is that those colors will have automated variants in dark mode.

For the whole list of system colors, and their semantic meaning, you can out the [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color), or check them out in the [CSS spec](https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-color/#css-system-colors).
