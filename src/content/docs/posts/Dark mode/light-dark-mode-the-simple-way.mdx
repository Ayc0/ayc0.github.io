In the previous post, we've seen how to use the `color-scheme` html meta tag to benefit from the browser default themes.

<LinkToPost slug="dark-mode/light-dark-mode-the-lazy-way" />

In this post, we’ll iterate on that and use our own styles.

## CSS variables

CSS variables ([documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)) are runtime variables that you can dynamically re-assign. For instance, consider this example:

```css
:root {
  --color: orange;
}
.color-blue {
  --color: blue;
}
* {
  color: var(--color);
}
```

By default, all elements will be in orange. But when wrapped in an element with the classname `color-blue`, their color will now be blue (and as usual in css, it cascades).

## Media query

Media queries aren't only useful for responsive design and changing the layout based on the screen size. When using [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme), you can modify your rendering based on if your user prefer to view their website in light/dark mode.

## End result

By combining both, you can create a color palette that will automatically adapt to your users preferences:

```css
:root {
  --text: black;
  --background: white;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --text: white;
    --background: black;
  }
}

body {
  color: var(--text);
  background: var(--background);
}
```

I'd still recommend adding a `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />` in your HTML as seen in the previous post to have native inputs that will look good in dark mode.
