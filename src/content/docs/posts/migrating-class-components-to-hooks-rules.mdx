When transitioning from classes to hooks, there are a few rules:

First, a few changes need to be done in the class component:

- remove as much code as possible from the constructor,
- use `componentDid<Cycle>` instead of unsafe `componentWill<Cycle>`:

| Instead of                  | Use these                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `componentWillMount`        | `componentDidMount`        |
| `componentWillReceiveProps` | `componentDidReceiveProps` |
| `componentWillUpdate`       | `componentDidUpdate`       |

I recommend you to check [react's doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops) if you want more information on the deprecation of these methods.

Then those are the main hooks you will want to use:

- use one `useState` hook per field in the state,
- use `useEffect` instead of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidReceiveProps`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`,
- use local variables instead of attributes / methods.

If those aren't enough, these are the final rules:

- if using local variables isn't possible, use `useCallback` for methods and `useMemo` for attributes,
- use `useRef` for refs or if you need to mutate a method/attribute in different places without triggering a re-render,
- and if you need a `useEffect` that runs synchronously after each render (for specific ui interactions), use `useLayoutEffect`.

If you want to see a concrete application of these rules, you can check this post in which I wrote a detailed migration of [react-only](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-only):
