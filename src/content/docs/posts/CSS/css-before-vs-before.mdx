When reading CSS code, we sometimes see code using `:before` and other times with `::before` (same for `::after`).

Is there a difference between the 2 notations? Is one correct?

## A bit of history

In CSS2, the syntax used at the time was `:before`. This was confusing because CSS also had _selectors_ like `:hover`, but they both had different semantic meanings.

So in [Selectors Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-3/#gen-content), they decided to change the syntax for `:before` to `::before` (and for legacy reasons, we can still use `:before`, but it is now deprecated).
The `:` notation isnâ€™t deprecated as a whole, instead the old syntax was split into two:

- `:` now represents pseudo-classes (and is still valid for `:hover` for instance),
- `::` represents pseudo-elements (and should be used for `::before`).

## `:pseudo-class`

Pseudo-classes represent variations of a state of an element.
When the condition is satisfied, the **whole** element is selected.

> A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).

### Example

- `:hover` matches an element on hover
- `:not(p)` matches an element if it's not a `p`
- `:last-of-type` matches an element that is the last of its siblings, and also matches a certain type selector.

## `::pseudo-element`

On the other hand, pseudo-elements are **parts** of the original element. They represent fake HTML nodes within the selected element.

> A CSS **pseudo-element** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

### Example

- `::before` corresponds to a slot just before this element,
- `::first-line` selects the first line in the current element,
- `::first-letter` retrieves the very first letter of the element.
