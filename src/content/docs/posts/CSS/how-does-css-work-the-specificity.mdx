import Codepen from "@components/Codepen.astro";

## Introduction

Let’s take this piece of code:

```html
<style>
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
  .blue {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<div class="red blue">Hello world</div>
```

What is the color of the text? Let’s try it out:

<Codepen user="ayc0" id="NWBBGbG" />

Congratulations if you picked blue!

The reason why the color appears blue is because the selector was defined last.

---

Now let’s try the same thing with:

```html
<style>
  #id {
    color: green;
  }
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
  div {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<div id="id" class="blue">Hello world</div>
```

What is the color of the text now? Let’s try it out:

<Codepen user="ayc0" id="qByymPr" />

It appears green. But why so?

## Specificity

### General rule

CSS uses multiple rules to determine how to apply styles and selectors to elements. One of them is the **specificity**: this is a score computed for each selector. Once all of them are computed, CSS will pick the selector with the **highest** specificity.

Let’s circle back to our 2nd example. If we display the specificity of each selectors, we have:

```css
#id {
  color: green;
} /* Specificity: (1, 0, 0) → WINS */
.red {
  color: red;
} /* Specificity: (0, 1, 0) */
div {
  color: blue;
} /* Specificity: (0, 0, 1) */
```

Which explains why the text appears `green`: `#id` has the highest specificity.

### Egality

If 2 selectors have the same specificity, then the last defined will take over, which explains the situation in our 1st example:

```css
.red {
  color: red;
} /* Specificity: (0, 1, 0) */
.blue {
  color: blue;
} /* Specificity: (0, 1, 0) & last one → WINS */
```

## How to compute the specificity

## General rules

The specificity is a list of 3 elements: `(A, B, C)`, where:

1. `A` is the ID selectors (e.g., `#example`)
2. `B` is the class selectors (e.g., `.example`), attributes selectors (e.g., `[type="radio"]`) and pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`)
3. `C` is the type selectors (e.g., `h1`) and pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`)

> If you want to check the differences between pseudo-classes (like `:hover`) and pseudo-elements (like `::before`), you can check this post: https://dev.to/ayc0/css-before-vs-before-1d35.

### Edge cases

- [`*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) (universal selector) and [`:where()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where) have **no specificity** `(0, 0, 0)`.
- `:is(…)`, `:not(…)`, and `:has(…)` pseudo-classes have the specificity of their most specific complex selector in their selector list argument.
  For instance: `:not(.class)` will have the same specificity as `.class` (aka `(0, 1, 0)`)
- `:nth-child(…)` and `:nth-last-child(…)` have the specificity of their most specific complex selector in their selector list argument **plus** their own specificity
  For instance: `:nth-child(2n of .class)` will have the same specificity as `.class` + `:nth-child` (aka `(0, 1, 0) + (0, 1, 0) = (0, 2, 0)`).

### Examples

- `.a.b.c` -> `(0, 3, 0)` (3 classes)
- `div#id` -> `(1, 0, 1)` (1 id + 1 element)
- `html` -> `(0, 0, 1)` | `:root` -> `(0, 1, 0)` (which in https://dev.to/ayc0/lightdark-mode-corrections-5e19#-raw-root-endraw-with-class-names I said that they both represent the same element with just different specificity
- `span > a[href$=".org"]:not([disabled])` -> `(0, 2, 2)` (2 elements (span & a) & 2 attributes selectors (href & not disabled)

### Combining selectors

When writing CSS rules, multiple selectors can be passed:

```css
[type="password"],
input:focus,
:root #myApp input:required {
  color: blue;
}
```

In those cases, it won’t create 1 giant agglomerated selector. Instead CSS will treat those as 3 distinct rules:

```css
[type="password"] {
  color: blue;
}
input:focus {
  color: blue;
}
:root #myApp input:required {
  color: blue;
}
```

And then it’ll continue as normal: find the selector with the highest specificity and apply it.

> If you want to know how to bump or increase the specificity of a selector, I’ll shortly release a separate article about it.

### Inline style

There are 2 ways of injecting styles in HTML:

- CSS style sheet that use selectors with specificity,
- inline style in HTML.

Inline style doesn't use selectors, and thus cannot have specificity. So how do they fit in this system?

We can think about it as a 4th element in the list `I`: `(I, A, B, C)`, that has more importance than the 3 others we’ve seen previously.

With this logic, in this example, "Hello World" should appear purple:

```html
<style>
  #id {
    color: green;
  }
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
  div {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<div id="id" class="blue" style="color: RebeccaPurple">Hello world</div>
```

<Codepen user="ayc0" id="VwBBqeo" />

### `!important`

Even if `!important` has nothing to do with specificity, it allows styles to be applied no matter what their specificity.

Which means that in this example: even if `div` has the lowest specificity, its style will be applied and the text will appear blue:

```html
<style>
  #id {
    color: green;
  }
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
  div {
    color: blue !important;
  }
</style>
<div id="id" class="blue" style="color: RebeccaPurple">Hello world</div>
```

<Codepen user="ayc0" id="YzjjdYy" />

Another article dedicated to how `!important` works will be released in the future.

### Tools

#### Parsel

When selectors become too complex, you can use [Parsel](https://projects.verou.me/parsel/), a library built by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/):

![Parsel parsing "#foo > .bar + div.k1.k2 [id='baz']:nth-child(2n of .k3):not(:where(#yolo))::before" and determining its specificity (1,6,2)](@assets/umseei3lx99qfkg9ip65.png)

#### VSCode

Similarly, VSCode can parse selectors and display their specificity on hover.
